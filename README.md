# Terminal Python Game

## Overview

Welcome to the Terminal Python Game project! This game simulates a command-line interface where players navigate through a spooky adventure using simple text commands. Inspired by choose-your-own-adventure stories and the [Terminus](https://github.com/mprat/Terminus?tab=readme-ov-file) project, the goal is to enhance your understanding of directory navigation and file handling in Python.

## Project Structure

This repository contains a base Python file (`TerminalController.py`) with method stubs for you to complete. Below are the key components of the project:

- **TerminalController.py**: This is the main file that will contain the game's logic. You will find method stubs for key functions that need to be implemented.
  - **LoadJsonMessage(fileName)**: This function will read a JSON file and display its content to the user.
  - **ListFiles()**: This function will list all files in the current directory, excluding JSON files.
  - **ChangeDirectory(directoryName)**: This function will change the current working directory based on user input.
  - **main()**: This function will initialize the game and handle user commands in a loop.
